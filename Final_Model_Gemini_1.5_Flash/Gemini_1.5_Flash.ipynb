      "Divya, a spirited artist with a penchant for vibrant colours, and Daya, a quiet scholar with a love for ancient texts, were an unlikely pair.  Their friendship, forged in the shared shade of a sprawling mango tree on the university campus, blossomed unexpectedly.  Divya, impulsive and generous, often shared her vibrant paintings, while Daya, contemplative and insightful, offered profound interpretations of their shared experiences.  One sweltering afternoon, a group of homeless children huddled near their tree, their hunger palpable.  Divya, moved by their plight, immediately decided to share her lunch – a delicious spread of homemade treats her mother had packed. Daya, initially hesitant, understood the depth of Divya's compassion.  He quietly added his own simple meal, a few chapatis and some pickle.  The children, initially shy, devoured the food with grateful smiles.  The shared meal transcended their different backgrounds, fostering a sense of unity and empathy.  Their simple act of kindness, born from an unexpected friendship, resonated far beyond the shade of the mango tree, leaving a lasting impression on both Divya and Daya.  They continued to look out for others, finding joy in their collective capacity to ease suffering and spread hope within their community.\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the Google Gemini-1.5-Flash API to generate age-appropriate, readable stories for children and adults, focusing on Indian contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Sections & Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setup & Installation\n",
    "- Instructions for obtaining and configuring a Gemini API key.\n",
    "- Installs required libraries: `google-generativeai`, `textstat`, `pandas`, `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. API Initialization\n",
    "- Loads the Gemini-1.5-Flash model using the API key from a `config.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Story Generation\n",
    "- `generate_story_with_title()` function:\n",
    "  - Accepts age range, genre, characters, and theme.\n",
    "  - Crafts a prompt with Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) targets based on age.\n",
    "  - Calls Gemini API to generate a story with a title and moral.\n",
    "  - Returns the title, story, and generation latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Evaluation\n",
    "- Functions to evaluate readability (`evaluate_story`, `evaluate_flesch`) using `textstat`.\n",
    "- Calculates Flesch Reading Ease, grade level, word/sentence/character counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Batch Story Generation & Analysis\n",
    "- Generates multiple stories for different age groups and genres.\n",
    "- Collects results in a DataFrame.\n",
    "- Calculates Flesch score errors, averages, and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for Flesch scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Flesch Score Reference Table\n",
    "- Provides a table mapping age ranges to target Flesch scores and reading difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "- The notebook is ready for both single and batch story generation.\n",
    "- It evaluates how well generated stories match the target readability for each age group.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:**  \n",
    "This notebook is a complete workflow for generating and evaluating children’s stories using the Gemini-1.5-Flash API, with a strong emphasis on age-appropriate"
